# Frontend Mentor - Interactive comments section solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive comments section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-comments-section-iG1RugEG9). The challenge is solved with the Next JS and Prisma (ORM). This was a nice challenge to demonstrate my skills as a full-stack developer. In this challenge, I never used API routes to mutate the database. All data mutations on the backend side have been handled through the Next JS server action.
